A coding challenge to compute token top ups for company users.

## Bootstrap of this repository

This repository was created using the following steps:

1. In GitHub, create a new public repository with a readme, .gitignore for Ruby and MIT license

2. In [Bing Chat](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/edge/features/bing-chat) enter the following prompt:

> As an expert Ruby developer, create a code base that is capable of parsing JSON and running XUnit style unit tests. It should use rubocop to validate code style according to community idiomatic guidelines and have a compatible editorconfig that works well with jetbrains rubymine. It should also have a dockerfile that allows this program to work well with a minimal ruby 3.2 base image. 

> Let's limit line length to 80 and method non-comment line count to 20

> Please add the line length limit to editorconfig as well, and suggest .gitignore additions for jetbrains rubymine

> rubocop should also ensure that every file ends with a newline

3. Copy the resulting code snippets from Bing Chat into the editor
